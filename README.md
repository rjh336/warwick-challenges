### Instructions
See "Python Exercises" for solutions to coding challenges 1 and 2.  
See "ds-1" for solution to the DS Regression challenge.  
See "ds-3" for solution to the DS Classification challenge.  
ds-1 and ds-3 are jupyter notebooks with embedded code, documentation, written commentary and plots.  
  
Additionally, I have uploaded my latest resume per the instructions. For more info on me please see my [blog](https://rjh336.github.io/).

### Free Response
The three traits I seek in a work place are the following:
1. The ability to expand my technical skill set (ML, programming, data architecture) and truly gain expertise in a particular industry or set of industries (whether that be through data analysis or by talking to industry experts).
2. The ability to gain mentorship for senior team members - I see this as crucial being that I am just starting out as a Data Scientist, and would like to get general career guidance along with practical guidance (e.g. code reviews, machine learning workshops).
3. The ability to have decent work-life balance - Before I went to the Metis boot camp I worked as a consultant who was always on the road (sometimes traveling from LA to NYC twice a week!). While I learned a lot on the road, I prefer to be able to come home most days in addition to keeping work separated from my personal life.
